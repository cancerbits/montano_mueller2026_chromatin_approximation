## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r rtheme}

https://github.com/wvictor14/rstudio_themes
# create temporary download directory
theme_49th_parallel <- fs::path_temp("49th_parallel-RStudio", 
                                     ext = "rstheme")
theme_asher <- fs::path_temp("asher-RStudio", 
                                     ext = "rstheme")
  
  https://github.com/michaelasher/CustomRStudioTheme/tree/master/RStudioStyleFiles/asher.rstheme
# download theme from github
download.file( "https://github.com/michaelasher/CustomRStudioTheme/tree/master/RStudioStyleFiles/asher.rstheme", 
              theme_asher)

download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wvictor14/rstudio_themes/master/49th%20Parallel.rstheme", 
              theme_49th_parallel)


# apply the theme
rstudioapi::addTheme(theme_49th_parallel, 
                     apply = TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
